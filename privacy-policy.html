    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>When you make a donation via PayPal, they collect your personal information, including your name and email address. PayPal securely handles this information and processes payments.

    <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use secure payment gateways like PayPal to handle donations. We do not store payment information on our site. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee 100% security due to the nature of internet data transmission.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
